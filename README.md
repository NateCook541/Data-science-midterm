# Data-science-midterm

I did everything in the slides from slide 34 on.
For the second part where I did stuff on my own I talked about one hot encoding, big O, analyzed the predication, and tried to improve it.
Sorry if you were looking for something else, but I feel like I got everything mentioned in the assignment description, but it did end up being pretty messy so sorry about that.
